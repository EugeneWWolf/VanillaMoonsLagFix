# VanillaMoonsLagFix
Works on the following moons:
- Artifice
- March
- Dine
- Rend

## What does it do?
This mod disables specific AudioReverbTriggers and WindTriggers which cause massive lag spikes around the ship for some reason.

No more, no less.

> :warning: These lag spikes are only visible if you're playing with a lot of mods.

## Multiplayer compatibility

This mod works on the client-side.
